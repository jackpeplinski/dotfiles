RULES:
- Do not leave comments in your code
- Do not leave any unused imports, variables, or functions in your code
- When writing tests, always ensure that there is 100% branch coverage for all files that you have modified.
- Whenever you write tests, ensure that you are following all relevant guidelines for writing tests (search for any cursor rules in the repo or CLAUDE.md files in the repo that include instructions about test writing)
- Before finishing anything you are working on, think hard to ensure that you have followed every single rule in this list, and also in the prompt I gave you

### General Coding Practices

1. **Avoid Adding Comments**: When making changes to files, avoid adding comments explaining the changes. The codebase should be self-documenting, and commit messages should explain the reasoning behind changes rather than inline comments. This keeps the code clean and minimizes noise.

## Commits

Follow the guidelines of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages. This includes using the appropriate prefixes (feat, fix, chore, etc.) and ensuring that the message is clear and descriptive.

## GitHub Workflow

This section outlines the exact process for interacting with GitHub, creating PRs, and managing issues.

### Issue and Pull Request Management

1. **Finding and Viewing Issues**:

   ```bash
   # List all issues in a repo
   gh issue list

   # List issues with specific label
   gh issue list --label "Discovery"

   # View a specific issue
   gh issue view ISSUE_URL --json comments,body,title,author,createdAt,closedAt,assignees,labels,number

   # Search issues with a query
   gh issue list --search "DiscoveryToggle in:title"
   ```

2. **Managing Labels**:

   ```bash
   # List all labels in a repo
   gh label list

   # Add label to issue
   gh issue edit ISSUE_URL --add-label "Label"

   # Remove label from issue
   gh issue edit ISSUE_URL --remove-label "Label"
   ```

3. **Finding and Viewing Pull Requests**:

   ```bash
   # List all PRs in a repo
   gh pr list

   # List PRs with specific label
   gh pr list --label "Discovery"

   # Search PRs with a query
   gh pr list --search "DiscoveryToggle in:title"

   # View a specific PR
   gh pr view PR_URL --json comments,commits,reviews,body,title,author,createdAt,closedAt,mergedAt,assignees,additions,deletions,changedFiles,labels,number
   # Viewing a specific PR's changed files (or diff) (optional)
   # total_diff_lines = data['additions'] + data['deletions']
   # MAX_DIFF_LINES = 1000
   # if total_diff_lines < MAX_DIFF_LINES
       gh pr diff PR_URL
   # else
       gh pr diff PR_URL --name-only

   # View a specific PR's review comments
   gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments
   ```

4. **Commenting on Issues and PRs**:

   ```bash
   # Add a comment to an issue
   # first, write the comment markdown contents to a TMP_FILE
   gh issue comment ISSUE_URL --body-file TMP_FILE

   # Add a comment to a PR
   # first, write the comment markdown contents to a TMP_FILE
   gh issue comment PR_URL --body-file TMP_FILE
   ```
   Important: Always prepend the comment with a note/disclaimer indicating that it was made with Claude Code, like this:
     > [!NOTE]
     > This comment was generated by Claude Code, an AI assistant. Please review it carefully before taking any action.
 Add/modify tests as needed so that there is 100% branch coverage, and all tests are passing

## Comments on Pull Requests or Changes

Follow the guidelines of [Conventional Comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) for comments on pull requests or changes. This includes using the appropriate prefixes (e.g., "issue", "todo", "question") and ensuring that the comment is clear and descriptive.

### General Tone

**In summary:** Use a tone is that of a knowledgeable peer sharing practical insights and experiences in a direct, personal, and accessible manner. It's professional yet conversational, driven by genuine interest and a desire to share useful information.

**Writing Style Guide**

**1. Overall Tone & Voice:**
    *   **Target Tone:** Informative, Pragmatic, Personal, Reflective, Accessible, Grounded Enthusiasm.
    *   **Voice:** Write in the **first person ("I," "my," "we" if applicable)**. Share your genuine thoughts, experiences, and learning process. Be authentic.
    *   **Attitude:** Be helpful and knowledge-sharing. Focus on practical application and real-world scenarios. Show enthusiasm for the topic but avoid unsubstantiated hype.

**2. Audience:**
    *   Assume an audience of **fellow tech professionals, developers, data engineers, or individuals interested in similar technical topics (Cloud, Data, Software).**
    *   While the audience is technical, don't assume they know *everything* you do. Briefly explain concepts or provide links for deeper dives where appropriate. Define acronyms on first use unless extremely common (like AWS, SQL).

**3. Purpose:**
    *   Clearly define the goal of each post: Is it to explain a concept, share a solution, document a project, review a tool, or reflect on a trend?
    *   Focus on providing **value** to the reader â€“ actionable insights, clear explanations, useful code snippets, lessons learned.

**4. Language & Word Choice:**
    *   **Clarity is Key:** Use clear, direct language. Avoid ambiguity.
    *   **Professional but Conversational:** Maintain a professional standard, but allow for a natural, conversational flow. Avoid overly formal or academic language. Contractions (like "don't," "it's") are acceptable.
    *   **Technical Terms:** Use appropriate technical terminology, but explain or link to definitions for less common terms or when introducing a concept.
    *   **Active Voice:** Prefer active voice ("I built a pipeline...") over passive voice ("A pipeline was built...") for more direct and engaging writing.
    *   **Conciseness:** Avoid unnecessary jargon, filler words, or overly long sentences. Get to the point.

**5. Sentence & Paragraph Structure:**
    *   **Sentence Length:** Vary sentence length for better rhythm, but generally favor shorter to medium-length sentences for clarity.
    *   **Paragraph Length:** Keep paragraphs relatively short and focused on a single idea or step. This improves readability, especially online.
    *   **Logical Flow:** Ensure smooth transitions between paragraphs and sections.

**6. Formatting & Structure:**
    *   **Titles:** Use clear, descriptive titles that indicate the post's content.
    *   **Headings & Subheadings:** Break up text with clear headings (H2, H3, etc.) to structure the content logically and make it scannable.
    *   **Lists:** Use bullet points (for unordered items) or numbered lists (for steps or ordered items) to enhance readability.
    *   **Code Blocks:** Use formatted code blocks for *any* code snippets, commands, or configuration examples. Specify the language if possible for syntax highlighting.
    *   **Emphasis:** Use **bold** for emphasis or highlighting key terms occasionally. Use *italics* sparingly, perhaps for specific terms or titles.
    *   **Links:** Link generously to external resources, documentation, related posts, or tools mentioned. Ensure links open in a new tab where appropriate.
    *   **Images/Diagrams:** Use screenshots, diagrams, or relevant images to illustrate points, break up text, and make complex ideas easier to grasp.

**7. Things to Avoid:**
    *   Excessive hype or marketing language.
    *   Overly strong opinions without justification or evidence.
    *   Complaining without offering solutions or constructive criticism.
    *   Dense blocks of text without breaks or formatting.
    *   Assuming too much prior knowledge without providing context or links.
    *   Vague or abstract language when concrete examples would be better.
