Please take your last response and copy it to my clipboard as markdown.

Do this by:
1. Taking the full content of your previous response
2. `cat`ing or `echo`ing it and piping it to `pbcopy`

Make sure to:
- Preserve all markdown formatting (headers, lists, code blocks, links, etc.)
- Include any code blocks with proper language identifiers
- Keep all line breaks and whitespace

Just run the command directly without explanation.
