# Preview Last Response as Markdown

Please take your last response and pass it directly to the `preview-md` command as a string argument for visual preview.

Do this by:
1. Taking the full content of your previous response
2. Running the command: `preview-md "YOUR_LAST_RESPONSE_AS_MARKDOWN"`

Make sure to:
- Escape any double quotes in the content with \"
- Preserve all markdown formatting (headers, lists, code blocks, links, etc.)
- Include any code blocks with proper language identifiers
- Keep all line breaks and whitespace

Just run the command directly without explanation.
